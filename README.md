`gtravyl` provides an easy way to take a grid-like layout and compute the shortest distance from any two desired cells in the grid.

# How does it work?

Suppose you are trying to create a real time strategy game. You may have a grid-like map internally represented as a `numpy` array. It might look something like:

```
0001111
0001111
0000000
1101110
1101110
```
where the `1` indicates you *cannot* travel into that cell. Now you want to move a character that is in the cell with index `(0, 0)` to the bottom right corner. Ideally, you would like to know the shortest path too. This can be done easily with `gtravyl`, observe:

```py
import numpy as np
import gtravyl as gt
world = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
                  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
                  [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]])
path = gt.shortest_path(world, (0, 0), (4, 6))
for cell in path:
    world[cell] = 2

print(world)
```

This gives a path (represented by the cells with `2`) that looks like one should expect:

```py
[[2 2 2 1 1 1 1]
 [0 0 2 1 1 1 1]
 [0 0 2 2 2 2 2]
 [1 1 0 1 1 1 2]
 [1 1 0 1 1 1 2]]
 ```
